## Basic library inventory website built with express and Mongoose

This is a simple website I made for the purpose of learning the express framework for NodeJS and Mongoose. I started this project by doing [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website) on the Mozilla Developer Network. A substantial amount of the code (about 50%) is copied directly from that tutorial.

The website is currently running on AWS and can be found at this link http://18.189.13.31:3000/.


## Features

## Installing

Install NodeJS and npm. Clone this repository. cd into the root folder. Install node packages by running `npm install`. Start the server by running `npm run start`. The server is now running on port 3000.
